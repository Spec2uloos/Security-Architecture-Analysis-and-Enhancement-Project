# Security-Architecture-Analysis-and-Enhancement-Project

* Overview
  
      This project aims to analyze the existing security architecture of a network, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and propose improvements based on best practices. The project includes network segmentation analysis, design proposals using Visio, and the implementation of security strategies such as intrusion detection, SSL decryption, and network access control.

  * Project Objectives
  
        Security Architecture Analysis
        
        Critically evaluate an existing security architecture.
        
        Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current setup.
        
        Recommendations for Improvement
        
        Propose recommendations to enhance the current architecture.
        
        Suggest changes in the number of zones and the placement of equipments
        
        Create a new secure architecture design using Visio.
        
        Introduce new physical and logical components as necessary.
        
        Recommend tools, their placement, and potential vendors.
        
        Network Access Control (NAC) Integration
        
        Focus on ensuring the integrity of critical data exchanges in the cloud.
        
        Document the step-by-step integration and configuration process.
